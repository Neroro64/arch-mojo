# This is a script to install the mojo programming language on Archlinux.
Since mojo needs a version of ncurses that is not available on normal way on Arch, you need to do some extra steps to get mojo working.

## Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sharktheone/arch-mojo/main/install.py -o /tmp/arch-mojo/install.py && python /tmp/arch-mojo/install.py
```
